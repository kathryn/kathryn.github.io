        <h1>Resumé</h1>

        <p>I am a San Francisco based full-stack web developer.</p>

        <p>I currently love working in JavaScript, building functional and expressive applications serving real-world user needs, using modern tooling and agile processes.</p>

        <p>I can bring value to a team by offering a wealth of experience and passion for creative ideas, communication, problem solving, and pushing the limits of technology while still developing for a positive user experience.</p>

        <p>I'm currently into JavaScript/CoffeeScript, Node.js/Express, AngularJS, and equally happy in the front or back ends.</p>

        <h2>Recently</h2>
        <p>My most recent project is <a href="http://stacker.cc/features" target="_blank">Stacker</a> - a tool and platform for visual storytelling.  It is comprised of a content-creation tool for developing and publishing pieces, and a framework for the self-contained, CDN-backed pieces themselves.</p>

        <p>I led development on the early prototypes and later the full implementation, which culminated in a rich single-page app featuring a real-time collaborative visual editor with both a WYSIWYG canvas and timeline interface.  It includes integration with Dropbox to enable designers to rapidly iterate, a clear but innovative animation system, and a CDN-backed publishing strategy to scale high traffic loads.</p>

        <h5>Buzzword-compliant stack & tools list:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>CoffeeScript/JavaScript</li>
          <li>Node.js / Express / MongoDB / Socket.io</li>
          <li>AngularJS / Jade</li>
          <li>Grunt / Karma / Jasmine / CircleCI / Heroku</li>
          <li>Integrations with Dropbox, AWS, Fastly</li>
          <li>Agile process, pairing, TDD, CI, CD</li>
        </ul>

          <a href="http://github.com/kathryn/eggs">Eggs (open source application for small meat farms)</a><br>
          I was inspired by leaders of the Slow Food movement to use Ruby on Rails to design and build a system for
          small meat farms to manage their CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) programs.  It is being used
          by at least two farms in the Bay Area, and helping solve many of the unique issues that a non-vegetable CSA
          program faces.  See <a href="http://github.com/kathryn/eggs">GitHub</a> page for more details on features.

            we brainstormed, prototyped, and deployed a new venture within CafePress
            using OpenLaszlo and Ruby on Rails.  I developed an application which
            allows users to design hundreds of different custom products online
            without the need for technical design application skills such as Photoshop, which
            has been deployed as CafePress's main Designer application.

          at-risk middle-school reader program.  Students use the application to see their current
          program books, track their progress, launch digital books, choose and launch quizzes
